The controller structure adheres to the standard ASP.NET Core Web API conventions, using attributes like [Route] and [ApiController] for routing and ApiController
behavior. Dependency injection is correctly utilized to inject the StudentProfileContext into the controller through the constructor, ensuring proper separation of 
concerns and testability. All action methods (GetStudentProfiles, GetStudentProfile, PutStudentProfile, PostStudentProfile, DeleteStudentProfile) follow the 
async-await pattern, making efficient use of resources in handling I/O-bound operations. The action methods for retrieving, updating, creating, and deleting student 
profiles are well-implemented and utilize Entity Framework Core methods like ToListAsync, FindAsync, Add, Remove, and SaveChangesAsync. Error handling is appropriately
implemented using ASP.NET Core's built-in mechanisms. For example, returning NotFound() when a requested resource is not found and returning BadRequest() for invalid 
requests. The PutStudentProfile method handles concurrency exceptions (DbUpdateConcurrencyException) gracefully. Security measures such as input validation and
password hashing are not explicitly implemented in this controller. Consider adding input validation to ensure data integrity and implementing secure password hashing
algorithms for storing passwords securely. The code follows C# coding conventions and is well-formatted, enhancing readability and maintainability.Comments explaining
complex logic or decision points could be beneficial for understanding the codebase, especially for future maintenance or when working in a team. Database interactions
are handled using Entity Framework Core, providing a convenient and efficient way to interact with the database without directly writing SQL queries.
